            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.The three types of CSS are external, internal, and inline. External CSS is a file that HTML files will link to. Internal CSS is specified at the beginning of an HTML document. Inline CSS is written for a specific element in the HTML document.</p>
